When another blog is created, there are always questions like 'why create another one, everybody is sharing nowadys?'

Here are my two cents. 

Usually it goes like this - I make notes into my booklet or right on the paper. Then, when time passes I can't find any of those pages aaand I need to read those subjects all over again.

With blog it is much easier - I can write everything down, most of the things are in one place and nicely categorized (thanks Hugo!).
I just click on tag and similar topics will pop up. Or similar categories. 


#### What I write about? 

Things I am (re)learning again. Mostly CS related.
